- We will keep the registration open but from here on all registrations will be
  via live-stream since we cannot change Zoom exercise groups
  at the last minute. Registrants will be able to follow the whole workshop
  and will be able to ask questions.
</div>

## Course goals

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for scientific software development.  We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to do programming well and avoid common inefficiency traps.
The tools we teach are
practically a requirement for any scientist that has to do their own programming. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.

## Format

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons,
live coding, and exercises. Learners are divided into exercise teams for
interactivity - register with a friend!  If you feel a bit more
confident in the material, you can [register as an exercise
leader](volunteer/).

The workshop will be held online, see options at [how to
join](join/):

* Everyone watches the main teaching via a livestream at
  <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>.  If you
  register, you can get emails and link to ask questions.

* You can also register to attend our Zoom breakout rooms (limited
  places), and you will be placed into a small, interactive breakout
  room.  Please only register for Zoom if you want to actively take
  part in the exercises ([read more](join/)).

* Some partners offer in-person breakout rooms and help, see below.

**Before signing up** please also read
[this privacy note about tools/services we use](requirements/#privacy-and-tools-online-services).

## Partners

These partners offer local support, such as breakout rooms, to their
local groups.  [Become a
partner](https://coderefinery.org/organization/partners/) to support
your community!

- [**Aalto University**](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/):
  - Local in-person breakout room: register on the main form as
    "type=livestream only" and "OK to give your contact detail to a
    breakout room organizer? = yes".  Room = U523 (days 1-3,6) and
    F336 (days 4-5).
  - Possibility of credit points to those in Finland (more info later).
- **TU Delft**: PhD candidates can receive graduate school credits. ([TU
  Delft registration](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/training-evenementen/training-voor-onderzoekers/coderefinery-workshop))

Other CodeRefinery partners include [ENCCS](https://enccs.se/) (SE),
[CSC](https://csc.fi) (FI), [DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/) (DK), [UNINETT
Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/) (NO), [SNIC](https://snic.se/) (SE),

[USIT, UiO](https://www.usit.uio.no/) (NO).

## Certificates and credits

We currently cannot offer attendance certificates or certificates for completing the workshop.

The reason why we cannot offer these is that for an online workshop of this size
it is difficult to track online attendance without compromising privacy and without putting too much
administrative strain on exercise group leaders.

However, certain partners may track attendance and provide certificates for their participants, see above.
