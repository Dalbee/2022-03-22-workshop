* You can help us with announcing the workshop to your colleagues and friends and also by recruiting helpers/ exercise leads who help us to scale.

</div>

## Course goals

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for scientific software development.  We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to do programming well and avoid common inefficiency traps.
The tools we teach are
practically a requirement for any scientist that has to do their own programming. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.

## Format

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons,
live coding, and exercises. Learners are divided into exercise teams for
interactivity - register with a friend!  If you feel a bit more
confident in the material, you can [register as an exercise
leader](volunteer/).

The workshop will be held online, see options at [how to
joining](join/).

* Everyone watches the main teaching via a livestream at
  <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>.  If you
  register, you can get emails and link to ask questions.

* You can also register to attend Zoom breakout rooms (limited
  places).  Please only register for Zoom if you want to actively take
  part in the exercises; we will arrange participants into small
  interactive breakout rooms.

* Some partners offer in-person breakout rooms and help, see below.
